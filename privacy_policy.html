    <p>We use commercially reasonable security practices to help keep the information collected through the App secure
        and take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account (if you have an
        account with us). However, Neural Reader cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Neural
        Reader or guarantee that information on the App may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
    <p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information
        and device identifiers, and for controlling access to communications between you and Neural Reader, at all
        times. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any third-party services
        you may choose to use in connection with the App.</p>
    <h2 id="retention">Retention</h2>
    <p>With respect to information that we may collect, we will retain such information in a personally identifiable
        format only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have set out in this Privacy Policy. You may
        also ask that we delete your information by <a href="#how-to-contact-us">contacting us</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="cross-border-data-transfers">Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>We and our service providers may store and process information in the United States and other countries. As a
        result, your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, jurisdictions that may not provide the
        same level of data protection as your jurisdiction.</p>
    <h2 id="international-data-transfers">International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>When we transfer personal information from the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Switzerland to countries
        that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection, we rely on appropriate legal
        mechanisms to ensure the lawful transfer of your data, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the
        European Commission and other applicable safeguards.</p>
    <p>Neural Reader may transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. Neural Reader maintains contracts with its third-party service providers that include appropriate data protection provisions restricting their access, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>
    <p>Neural Reader commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy should first contact Neural Reader at support@neuralreader.com. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint to your satisfaction, you may submit a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Neural Reader may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
    <h2 id="children">Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 4, and our <a href="terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a> do
        not allow children under 4 years of age to use the App. If we learn that we have collected personal information
        from a child under 4, we will delete it. We encourage parents with concerns to <a
            href="#how-to-contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="changes-to-the-privacy-policy">Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy
        Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the App. We may, and if
        required by law, will, provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to
        reach you, such as through the App.</p>
    <p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon
        implementation of the new changes on the App (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases,
        your continued use of the App after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the
        terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>California Residents&rsquo; Privacy Rights</h3>
    <p>Except as excluded from the scope of this notice above, the CCPA grants California residents the following
        rights.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">Information.</span> You can request information about how we have collected, used and
            shared your personal information during the past 12 months. We have made this information
            available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this notice, in the above
            chart.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Access.</span> You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain
            about you.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">Deletion.</span> You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or
            maintain about you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive
        information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a
        deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.</p>
    <p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p>
    <h3>How to Submit a Request</h3>
    <p>To request access to or deletion of personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>email: <a href="mailto:support@neuralreader.com">support@neuralreader.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="strong">Identity verification.</span> The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual
        submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the
        request. We may attempt to verify your identity by asking you to confirm information that we have on file about
        you or your interactions with us. Where we ask for additional personal information to verify your identity, we
        will only use it to verify your identity or your authority to make the request on behalf of another consumer.
    </p>
    <p><span class="strong">Authorized agents.</span> California residents can empower an &ldquo;authorized agent&rdquo;
        to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have written authorization
        confirming such authority.</p>
