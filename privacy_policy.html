We will tell you what information you must provide to use the App by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Third-party platforms or social media networks.</span> If you choose to connect to the App via a third-party platform or social media network, such as by using Facebook login, you may have the ability to limit the information that we may obtain from the third-party at the time you login to the App using the third-party&rsquo;s authentication service or otherwise connect your account.

If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.</p>
<h2>Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services</h2>
<p>The App may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites, mobile applications and online services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.</p>
<h2>Security Practices</h2>
<p>We use commercially reasonable security practices to help keep the information collected through the App secure and take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account (if you have an account with us). However, Neural Reader cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to Neural Reader or guarantee that information on the App may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information and device identifiers, and for controlling access to communications between you and Neural Reader, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Neural Reader make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.</p>
<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>With respect to information that we may collect, we will retain such information in a personally identifiable format only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have set out in this Privacy Policy. You may also ask that we delete your information by <a href="#how-to-contact-us">contacting us</a>.</p>
<h2>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
<p>We store the information we collect in connection with the App on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. For Amazon Web Services, we specify the US as the data storage location. Your personal information may be accessed by our service providers in other locations outside of your state, province, or country. Your device ID (and general App usage information) may also be accessed by the Company&rsquo;s technical support team in other locations outside of your state, province, or country. We rely on the Privacy Shield, as described <a href="#eu-us-privacy-shield">below</a>, for transfers of data from the EU and Switzerland to Neural Reader in the United States.</p>
<h2 id="eu-us-privacy-shield">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</h2>
<p>Neural Reader is the US entity that publishes and hosts the App. Neural Reader complies with the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. Neural Reader has submitted its certification to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Neural Reader may transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. Neural Reader maintains contracts with its third-party service providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of personal information in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations. Neural Reader may be liable if these third parties fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Neural Reader commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. European individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy should first contact Neural Reader at <span id="ckcaul4qg0001kqfpy23egql2"></span>. Neural Reader has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. If neither Neural Reader nor JAMS resolves your complaint, you may have the ability to engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. Additional information on the arbitration process is available on the Privacy Shield website at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Neural Reader may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Neural Reader&rsquo;s compliance with the Privacy Shield. Neural Reader&rsquo;s commitments under the Privacy Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 4, and our <a href="https://neural-reader.github.io/web/terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a> do not allow children under 4 years of age to use the App. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under the age of 4, we will delete it. We encourage parents with concerns to <a href="#how-to-contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the App. We may, and if required by law, will, provide notification of changes in another way that we believe is reasonably likely to reach you, such as through the App.</p>
<p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the App (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the App after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>California Residents&rsquo; Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Except as excluded from the scope of this notice above, the CCPA grants California residents the following rights.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="strong">Information.</span> You can request information about how we have collected, used and shared and used your personal information during the past 12 months. We have made this this information available to California residents without having to request it by including it in this notice, in the above chart.</li>
<li><span class="strong">Access.</span> You can request a copy of the personal information that we maintain about you.</li>
<li><span class="strong">Deletion.</span> You can ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example, prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must comply with a deletion request. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you.</p>
<p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p>
<h3>How to Submit a Request</h3>
<p>To request access to or deletion of personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'; font-size: 1rem;">email:&nbsp;support@neuralreader.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="strong">Identity verification.</span> The CCPA requires us to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request to access or delete personal information before providing a substantive response to the request. We may attempt to verify your identity by asking you to confirm information that we have on file about you or your interactions with us. Where we ask for additional personal information to verify your identity, we will only use it to verify your identity or your authority to make the request on behalf of another consumer.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Authorized agents.</span> California residents can empower an &ldquo;authorized agent&rdquo; to submit requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to have written authorization confirming such authority.</p>
